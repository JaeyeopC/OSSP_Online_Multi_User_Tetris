# About

This project is an extended version of the classic Tetris game designed to provide improved user experience (UX), competitive gameplay, and multiplayer interaction. Built in Java, the game expands a traditional single-player Tetris into a feature-rich multiplayer system with items, multiple game modes, sound effects, and multi-window gameplay.

This work was developed as part of the **2017 Open Source Software Programming (OSSP) course project**.
